            <h3>A little story about us</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              I walked through the door with you 
              The air was cold 
              But somethin bout it felt like home somehow 
              And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house 
              And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now 
              Oh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze 
              We’re singing in the car getting lost upstate
              Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place 
              And I can picture it after all these days 
              And I know it’s long gone and that magic’s not here no more 
              And I might be ok but I’m not fine at all…
            <p>
              Over the years, we have lived our own lives. Maybe we experience joy, sadness, and other life experiences. One day, fate brought us to meet again even though it started from an Instagram DM and this is where the conversation started, memories were shared, and a strong connection was felt.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cause there we are again on that 
              Little town street 
              You almost ran the red 
              Cause you were looking over at me 
              Wind in my hair, I was there 
              I remember it all too well
            </p>

            <p>
              Photo album on the counter 
              Your cheeks were turning red
              You used to be a little kid with glasses
              in a twin-sized bed 
              And your mother’s telling stories bout you on 
              the tee ball team 
              You taught me bout your past 
              Thinkin your future was me
              And you were tossing me the car keys 
              ‘F*** the patriarchy’ keychain on the ground
              We were always skipping town
              And I was thinking on the drive down
              Any time now, he’s gonna say it’s love
              You never called it what it was
              til we were dead and gone and buried 
              Check the pulse and come back 
              Swearing it’s the same, after 3 months in the grave
              And then you wondered where it went to
              As I reached for you but
              All I felt was shame
              And you held my lifeless frame 
              And I know it’s long gone and 
              There was nothing else I could do 
              And I forget about you long enough
              To forget why I needed to… 
            </p>

            <p>
               Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
              We’re dancin round the kitchen in the 
              refrigerator light
              Down the stairs, I was there
              I remember it all too well…
              And there we are again 
              When nobody had to know
              You kept me like a secret
              But I kept you like an oath
              Sacred prayer and we’d swear 
              to remember it all too well 
            </p>

             <p>
                Well maybe we got lost in translation 
                Maybe I asked for too much
                But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
                Til you tore it all up
                Running scared, I was there
                I remember it all too well
                And you call me up again 
                Just to break me like a promise 
                So casually cruel in the name of being honest 
                I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
                Cause I remember it all, all, all 
                They say all’s well that ends well
                But I’m in a new hell every time
                You double-cross my mind
                You said if we had been closer in age
                Maybe it would have been fine
                And that made me want to die.
            </p>

            <p>
             The idea you had of me
              Who was she?
              A never-needy, ever lovely jewel
              Whose shine reflects on you
              Not weeping in a party bathroom
              Some actress asking me what happened
              You.
              That’s what happened: You.
              You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
              Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show
              But then he watched me watch the front door 
              all night, willing you to come
              And he said, “it’s supposed to be fun… 
              Turning 21” 
            </p>

            <p>
              Time won’t fly
              It’s like I’m paralyzed by it 
              I’d like to be my old self again
              But I’m still trying to find it 
              After plaid shirt days 
              And nights when you made me your own
              Now you mail back my things 
              And I walk home alone
              But you keep my old scarf
              From that very first week
              Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me 
              You can’t get rid of it
              Cause you remember it all too well
            </p>

            <p>
              Cause there we are again when
              I loved you so 
              Back before you lost the one real thing
              You’ve ever known
              It was rare, I was there
              I remember it all too well
              Wind in my hair, you were there 
              You remember it all 
              Down the stairs, you were there 
              You remember it all
              It was rare, I was there
              I remember it all too well
            </p>

            <p>
              And I was never good at telling jokes 
              But the punchline goes:
              “I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”
              From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
              I’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight
              And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
              Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
              Cause in this city’s barren cold
              I still remember the first fall of snow
              And how it glistened as it fell
              I remember it all too well
            </p>

            <p>
              Just between us did the love affair maim you 
              All too well
              Just between us, do you remember it 
              All too well
              Just between us, I remember it all too well
            </p>
                
            <p>
              Wind in my hair 
              I was there, I was there
              Down the stairs, I was there
              I was there
              Sacred prayer
              I was there, I was there
              It was rare, you remember it
              All too well
